# WildTrax: an open platform for the management, storage, processing, sharing and discovery of avian data

As environmental sensors become indispensable tools for monitoring and assessing bird population trends, their effectiveness depends on robust systems capable of managing the large, and often overwhelming, datasets they generate. WildTrax (https://www.wildtrax.ca) is a web-based platform built to manage, store, process, share, and discover environmental sensor data from local to international scales. Through its ongoing development and maintenance, WildTrax enables researchers to address ecological questions across multiple spatial and temporal scales, while strengthening the avian data network, fostering collaboration, and enhancing data sharing to support bird conservation in Canada and beyond.
