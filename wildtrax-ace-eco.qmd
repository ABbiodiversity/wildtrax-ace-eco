# Introduction

Birds have long been recognized as ecological indicators (@temple1989bird, @bibby1999making, @canterbury2000bird, @gregory2003using, @mekonen2017birds) due to their sensitivity to environmental changes (@furness2013birds), broad distribution across ecosystems (@orme2006global, @jetz2012global, @aide2013real, @lepage2014avibase), and measurable population dynamics (@reif2013long). They can signal shifts in ecosystem health (@zakaria2005comparison, @newman2007aquatic, @smits2013avian) and function (@sekercioglu2012bird, @sitters2016bird, @morante2017appraisal), providing integral metrics (@stanton2016flexible, @michel2020metrics) for conservation and management. Birds are also valuable indicators because they occupy diverse niches, have well-studied life histories, and often correlate with the health of other taxa (@fleishman2005using). Their utility spans ecosystem monitoring, habitat quality assessment, and gauging the impact of environmental stressors such as land use change, climate change (@jiguet2007climate), and pollution (@niemi1997critical, @mekonen2017birds). Advances in statistical modelling now allow for better integration of uncertainty, phylogenetic relationships, and temporal autocorrelation, enhancing the reliability of bird-based indicators (@fraixedas2020state). However, there remains challenges in their application as indicators, including spatial, seasonal, and habitat biases, as well as insufficient consideration of statistical uncertainty and temporal autocorrelation in multi-species bird indicators (@gregory2003using, @fraixedas2020state).

Environmental sensors, such as autonomous recording units (ARUs) and remote camera traps, are reshaping avian monitoring by providing continuous, high-resolution, and large-scale data collection (@hobson2002acoustic, @shonfield2017autonomous, @pollet2025technological). The adoption of ARUs has allowed single-visit human surveys to be supplemented or replaced with archived acoustic recordings, enabling “big data” approaches that integrate multiple datasets for broader ecological inference (@hampton2013big; @farley2018situating; @shin2015ecological; @nathan2022big; @peters2014harnessing; @hallgren2016biodiversity) while still being statistical harmonized across methodologies (@solymos2013calibrating) with detectability rates depend on factors such as distance from the ARU, frequency range, and habitat structure (@yip2017experimentally). Remote camera traps have likewise become valuable tools for avian research, particularly for documenting nesting behavior, predation events, and species presence in otherwise inaccessible habitats (@bolton2007remote; @randler2018distance; @o2008picture). When deployed alongside ARUs, cameras provide complementary visual evidence that strengthens ecological inference, highlighting the advantages of multimodal sensor programs (@buxton2018pairing; @garland2020acoustic). Both sensors generate large ecological media datasets, often characterized as ‘big data’ due to their volume, variety (e.g., different file types), veracity (uncertainty in data quality such as noise or misclassification), and velocity (rate of accumulation or acquistion, @hampton2013big; @farley2018situating). Centralized software platforms facilitate standardization, integration, and sharing of these data, enabling interdisciplinary collaboration and advancing biodiversity research, and helping to reduce bias (@peters2014harnessing). Notably, machine learning is being combined with ecological models to meet computational demands, positioning sensors and big data systems to link raw ecological observations with actionable conservation strategies and sustainability goals (@nathan2022big) and minimizing data waste (@binley2023minimizing). 

To maximize their utility in an open framework, biodiversity data must align with FAIR principles: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (@kush2020fair). However, challenges persist around data quality, equitable access, and long-term preservation, highlighting the importance of strong and lasting socio-technical frameworks (@shin2015ecological). Software platforms that implement these principles and harmonize diverse datasets while maintaining consistency, equity, and quality can unlock advanced species- and community-level analyses, ultimately transforming raw observations into actionable insights for conservation and policy (@stephenson2020inventory; @fox2017generating). By overcoming limitations of traditional methods and promoting open data-sharing, such platforms enhance understanding of ecological trends (@buxton2021key) and foster collaboration among stakeholders, aligning priorities across regional to global scales (@kartez2008information). Here we introduce WildTrax, a platform for storing, managing, processing, sharing, and discovering avian environmental sensor data. This paper describes version 2.0 of WildTrax, corresponding with its 2025 release.

# Methods

## Database

### Infrastructure

WildTrax uses PostgreSQL, a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). PostgreSQL is well-suited for managing complex biodiversity datasets and rich metadata that accompanies ARU and remote camera data, offering optimized querying, relational structure, and robust storage capabilities (@douglas2003postgresql; @zhang2009efficiently; @kim2021ecobank). The application infrastructure runs on a virtualized server environment configured for dedicated applications. This architecture supports both daily user interactions and more computationally intensive batch tasks, such as uploading large volumes of audio and image files or running artificial intelligence classifiers for species recognition or object detection. To ensure reliability and performance at scale, the system employs load balancing and redundancy measures, enabling near-continuous availability for a large and growing user base. The production server is hosted at the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada), with optional long-term storage services available both at the University of Alberta server or through Amazon Web Services (AWS) with nodes available in Calgary, Alberta, Canada; Montreal, Quebec, Canada; and Oregon. Off-site storage uses [AWS Deep Glacier](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/) providing a recommended 3-2-1 data backup policy (@perkel2019ways). To optimize performance, a local M.2 drive paired with a CPU significantly reduces I/O bottlenecks, enabling data read / write speeds multiple times faster than traditional SSD NAS configurations. In practice, these enhancements improve query response times and batch processing speeds, while the upgraded CPU delivers smoother responsiveness and improved multitasking during high-demand operations. Media files are indexed and linked to the storage location option an Organization chooses.

### Role-based access and data security

WildTrax uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), a third-party role-based access control (RBAC) system that provides secure login and token-based authentication and authorization. Data membership and access follow the principle of least privilege, with permissions managed at both the Organization and Project levels. At the Organization level, users are assigned either an Administrator role, with full read–write access, or a Read-Only role, which restricts modifications to protect data integrity. Organizations may also designate a Principal Investigator (PI), who serves as the primary account for handling access requests. If a PI is not assigned, requests are directed to Organization and Project Administrators. At the Project level, roles provide more granular control. Administrators have full management access, including user assignments and data syncing. Taggers can annotate media but do not have administrative privileges. Read-Only users have view-only access, enabling collaboration without altering project data.

### Schemas

WildTrax employs a hierarchical structure to maintain data integrity, enforce standardization, and support interoperability of environmental sensors. The system is built around three primary data schemas, ARUs, cameras, and point counts, which are organized within Projects. Projects serve as centralized containers for all observations and sensor outputs linked to a specific study or research question. At a higher level, Organizations aggregate multiple Projects, bringing sensor data and media together under a unified framework. In addition, species schemas are managed across multiple taxonomic levels, enabling both standardized presets and the custom addition of species within individual Projects.

![Entity relationship diagram of the common WildTrax schema](assets/common-schema.png){.lightbox}

![Organization locations tab](assets/organization-locations.png){.lightbox}

Media uploaded to WildTrax, whether recordings or images, must include a string name prefix and media date-time stamp. For recordings this is contained in the media file name (e.g. `LOCATION_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) and within the parent folder name and EXIF metadata in image files. This way, each media file is explicitly linked to its parent Location, the precise geographic point of deployment, ensuring that sensors and their outputs remain inseparable from their environmental context. The schema enforces referential integrity while streamlining front-end operations such as data retrieval, filtering, and visualization through optimized queries and external APIs. For example, temporal metadata is standardized across sensors (`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`), while spatial coordinates are consistently defined at the Location level (longitude, latitude; WGS84). This framework enables multi-dimensional analyses that integrate raw sensor output with ecological, climatic, and biogeographic patterns. From the parent Location, metadata can be expanded through various Organizational tabs: Location Photos for visual records of the landscape or context of the Location, Visits for records of when an observer visited a Location; Equipment, an indexed inventory of devices used to collect media; and Deployments, the record of a specific piece of equipment deployed during a Visit. Together, these metadata provide users with precise information on the exact equipment used to survey each Location and collect media files. This detail strengthens data quality by enabling issues related to mechanical failure, physical damage, environmental conditions, or recording errors to be traced and validated later during processing tasks.

## User interface and user experience (UI/UX)

WildTrax’s user interface is a responsive web application built with [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/, version 3), leveraging its modular component-based architecture, including the Composition API, for scalability, maintainability, and efficient logic reuse. The user interface (UI) is styled and enhanced using [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/), among other libraries, which delivers rich, customization components such as data tables and dashboards for seamless data exploration and visualization. The application is deployed via an Apache HTTP Server, which serves the front-end and handles API routing through reverse-proxy configurations to back-end services. WildTrax exposes APIs for data exchange and provides export tools in standard scientific formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, text and zip), supporting downstream integration with statistical and geospatial workflows.

![ARU context menu for a public project](assets/context-menu-public.png){.lightbox}

Dashboards are designed to give users a clear, intuitive overview of their sensors’ data, enabling both novice and expert users to navigate and interpret project information with minimal friction. Key features, including filters, sorting, clearly labeled column headers with hover information, and tooltips, are complemented by dropdown menus accessed through responsive, context-aware controls, allowing users to refine or manipulate large datasets quickly without navigating complex database relationship structures. Visual elements such as sortable data tables, progress indicators, and status icons support efficient user scanning and pattern recognition, while maintaining consistency with the broader WildTrax design system. Attention to micro-interactions, such as inline feedback and notifications when data are updated or filters applied, reinforces a sense of responsiveness and reduces cognitive user load. The dashboard prioritizes transparency by linking each dataset directly back to its associated location and media, ensuring users can trace results from summary views down to the raw sensor files from Tasks to Organizations. WildTrax 2.0 incorporates a new content management system (CMS) that provides support for translation (currently supported in English and French), internationalization (i18n), and content localization, ensuring that the platform can accommodate multilingual users and diverse regional requirements.

![Content management system](assets/cms.png){.lightbox}

![ARU recording upload popup](assets/aru-upload.png){.lightbox}

Each sensor processing interface and data management capabilities are tailored to the unique characteristics of its respective data type while ensuring consistency in data harmonization, design, and usability. Within each sensor type, ARUs, cameras and point counts, Projects serve as the core organizational unit, enabling users to upload media, manage processing tasks from recordings or image sets, integrate external data, assign species and user roles, verify species tags, attach ancillary metadata and files, and publish results for discovery and use by other members and the broader community.

### Acoustic sensor

The design of the acoustic sensor workflow is to provide a few steps as possible to maximize the use of the acoustic data for any level of user. Supported audio files types are WAC and W4V ([Wildlife Acoustics](https://www.wildlifeacoustics.com/) proprietary lossless compressed file types), [FLAC](https://github.com/xiph/flac) (open-source lossless compressed file types), MP3 (lossy compressed audio; (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III)) and WAV (uncompressed audio). All uploaded file types, except MP3, are converted to using a lossless audio codec, FLAC, that preserves bit-for-bit fidelity while reducing storage needs by approximately 30–70% compared to WAV. FLAC also allows researchers to uncompress the lossless data for use in other applications, avoided any issues that arise with lossy data compression (@macphail2024audio).

Recordings can be uploaded to either Projects or Organizations, with all media ultimately owned and stored at the Organization level. Within an Organization, recordings are aggregated in the Recordings tab, where users can generate Tasks based on pre-selected criteria with over 40 filters are available, grouped into Weather, Location, Recording, Species, and Astronomical conditions. For example, users can select recordings with a BirdNET confidence threshold of 0.8, during a new moon, and between 6 AM and 9 AM. These selected recordings are placed in a cart and can then be generated into a Project. This workflow is unprecedented, as it allows users to manage all their media centrally while creating Projects only for the specific questions they want to investigate.

![Acoustic task selection process with filters applied for recordings with Swainson's Thrushes on partly cloudly detected](assets/task-selector.png){.lightbox}

At the Project level, uploaded recordings become Tasks also allowing the users to assign a duration, processing method and observer to their recording. This unique combination allow recordings to be re-processed at different durations, observers or processing methods allowing for multi-observer data processing (@macphail2025unpublished) and flexibililty of re-using the same audio data for different processing methodologies or questions. Once audio recordings are archived, they are then dynamically converted into spectrograms, visual representations of the audio signals using short-time Fourier transforms (STFT) using the [SoX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sox/) within the acoustic processing interface. Default project parameters (X-scale for duration of time and Y-scale for spectrogram height in pixels, and colour formatting) define the size and style of the spectrogram but can be changed dynamically using the Audio Settings panel to modify the dimensions and range of the spectral signatures in order to isolate frequency ranges. This is particularly useful to isolate the range of species that can in narrow frequency bands. 

![Dynamic audio settings panel](assets/dynamic-audio-settings.png){.ligthbox}

![Ruffed Grouse non-vocal drumming](assets/ruffed-grouse.png){.lightbox}

The processing interface allows users to play back audio while simultaneously viewing the spectrogram, providing both auditory and visual interaction with the data. This setup enables users to isolate individuals across recordings by examining signal directionality (left vs. right channel), intensity (loudness), timing or frequency of vocalizations, and distinct song types. By combining these features with visual and auditory interpretation, experts can curate recordings with high precision and accuracy for both species identification and count estimates.

![Acoustic processing interface showcasing multiple Yellow Warblers signing with different intensities, directionality and timing](assets/yellow-warblers.png){.lightbox}

Various panels support and enhance the acoustic processing UX and accessibility to external data. The Weather panel provides environmental context, including temperature, wind speed, precipitation at the nearest hour of the recording, as well as sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and lunar phase. The AI-assisted classification panel displays species predictions at 1.5-second intervals along the spectrogram, with outputs filterable by classifier-specific score thresholds (BirdNET and HawkEars), with access to the overlays enabled by Project Administrators. The Noise panel allows users to annotate geophonic noise (e.g., wind, rain, ocean), anthropogenic noise (e.g., industry, traffic), or equipment malfunctions. Noise events can be further categorized by channel (left/right), amplitude (low to extreme), and frequency (intermittent, frequent, constant, infrequent). Access to Location Photos also aids species identification and helps assess landscape factors, such as dense vegetation or human features, that may influence species detection or noise parameters.

![Acoustic sensor layout with major components](assets/acoustic-sensor.png){.lightbox style="float:left; border:1px solid #ccc; padding:4px;" fig-alt="Acoustic processing interface" fig-align="center"}

Species detections are recorded as Tags, created when a human observer draws a bounding box around an acoustic signal on the spectrogram. Each Tag captures temporal and frequency information, including date and time of first detection, duration, and frequency range (Hz). The Tag Info Panel enables rapid entry of metadata such as individual identifiers, count estimates, vocalization type, confidence flags, and comments. This structure allows flexibility, for example, a flocking species may be represented by a single Tag with a count estimate greater than one. Tagging is further guided by the Task Method, which enforces consistency and reduces inappropriate annotations. 

![Acoustic species verification](assets/species-verification.png)

Tags are grouped by species, and validators review them to confirm or edit key information (e.g., species, count, vocalization). Verification occurs in two steps: Tags are first created or imported, then reviewed by species–vocalization type. Each Tag is either confirmed as Verified or reclassified as Transcribed. The Species tab provides summaries of verification status along with tools for managing validators and tracking workflow progress.

Automated classification outputs (e.g., single-species recognizers or alternative models) can also follow a parallel workflow. Recordings are uploaded and converted into Tasks, after which classifier-generated Tags are imported via the sync functionality, which supports CSV-based import/export. Validators can then review, correct, or remove these Tags, and may rate them to assess classifier performance. Some classifier may only provide a user limited data, such as the window or start time, in the former case, classifier Tags can be uploaded simply with the signal start time and WildTrax will generate the average frequency and duration of that species' signal based on the Tags already in the database. Users can then adjust Tag dimensions manually as necessary.

### Camera sensor

The camera sensor in WildTrax is designed supports the ingestion, processing, and validation of image data from remote cameras. The design of the camera sensor was inspired by elements of the original ABMI camera processing interface (cameras.abmi.ca) and with inspiration from [Wildlife Insights](https://www.wildlifeinsights.org/) (@ahumada2020wildlife) and [TimeLapse](http://www.saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) (@greenberg2012timelapse). Images are uploaded at the Project level, with ownership and long-term storage again retained by the Organization, and role-based access accordingly, similar to ARU. Image sets are created from the start and end date of deployed images which then become Tasks, a unique combination of Project, User and Image Set, which can be assigned to analysts for processing and validation. Upon upload, Project Administrators can automatically pre-process images using MegaDetector V6 (@beery2023megadetector), a convolutional neural network that detects animals, people, vehicles, and empty images. It performs especially well on medium- to large-bodied mammals, humans, and vehicles, and effectively filters out false triggers and blanks. However, its performance is limited, particularly in cases of partial occlusion, rapid movement, or low image resolution. For this reason, human tagging still remains a required step to ensure accuracy and to add finer-scale annotations and metadata

![](assets/camera-tagging.png){.lightbox}

Following pre-classification, images enter the human tagging stage, where analysts confirm or correct the automated tags and apply additional metadata fields (e.g., species, sex, age class, behaviour). To accommodate the limitations of automated detection for avian taxa, WildTrax allows analysts to apply species-level codes to birds not detected by MegaDetector and to supplement metadata across sequences of images where birds are observed but inconsistently classified. 

The processing interface provides two principal analysis modes: in Series Mode, images are displayed in chronological order, preserving event structure and allowing analysts to interpret sequences of activity (e.g., repeated detections, interspecific interactions); and in full Tagging Mode, all images are accessible through a filterable tagging interface, enabling users to isolate subsets of images based on pre-classified tags, metadata, or Project-specific codes. Processed outputs are stored as structured metadata linked directly to the image files

### Point count sensor

![](assets/pc-dashboard.png)

The Point Count Sensor functions as a central repository for the [Boreal Avian Modelling Centre’s](borealbirds.ca) or BAM's point count data, consolidating observations from multiple surveys into a standardized framework. Point counts are harmonized into specific distance bands, ensuring that methods are consistent with those used for Autonomous Recording Units (ARUs), which facilitates integrated analyses across data types. When exporting ARU data, users can configure it to match a point count format, for example, treating all detections within a single ARU as belonging to a 0–∞ m distance band, allowing synthesis with traditional point count datasets. This harmonization helps to ensure comparability of abundance estimates, species occurrence, and spatial patterns between ARU and human-observed point count data.
 
![](assets/pc-surveys.png)

## Data publication and sharing

When the Project is completed and all Tasks processed, the status of the Project can be changed to a published status. Project publication allows other WildTrax users, who are not Project members, to access the media, metadata or species detections from the project either through the Project context menus to Download Report or [Data Discover](https://discover.wildtrax.ca/). The publication status will control how data will become visible across the system. Project publication will lock users from editing species detections and is considered the final version of the data. In addition, for every published Project, WildTrax facilitates the open avian data network by providing a unique for [NatureCounts](https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/main.jsp). Data are converted with a format flag on the `download-report` API to meet BDME (Bird Monitoring Database Exchange; https://naturecounts.ca/nc/default/nc_bmde.jsp) requirements and aligned with NatureCounts’ permission levels.

  )
)

datatable(
  statuses,
  rownames = FALSE,
  options = list(pageLength = 10, autoWidth = TRUE)
)


```

### Reports

Each sensor is customized with a series of reports of data. Reports are purported to be abstractions and summaries of data collected across each sensor for various reasons. Each report serves a specific purpose to allow downstream users to analyze their data. 

```{r}
#| eval: true

# wildrtrax report downloads for main report
names(wt_download_report(620, 'ARU', reports = 'main', weather_cols = T)) |>
  as_tibble() |>
  rename(column_name = value) |>
  print(n = Inf)

```

### Data Discover

Data Discover is the central hub for exploring environmental sensor data in WildTrax. In Data Discover, users and the public can search for data from ARUs, cameras, and point counts, using a variety of attribute filters, and create summary statistics within a dynamic mapping interface. Users can gain a comprehensive understanding of environmental sensor data in an area that interests them noting which organizations have published data on WildTrax, which species were detected and to what frequency, and explore media elements such as images and sounds captured in the environment.

## Analysis with wildrtrax

`wildrtrax` (pronounced wild-r-tracks) is the corresponding R package containing functions to help manage and analyze the corresponding Report data. It also helps to simplify the entire data life cycle with WildTrax by offering tools for data pre-processing (file scanning, renaming), wrangling, and analysis, in order to facilitate seamless data transfer to and from WildTrax. `wildrtrax` helps users to establish their end-to-end workflows and to help ensure reproducibility in their analyses. `wildrtrax` functions are called and reflected with GET and POST APIs available throughout the system. All functions begin with `wt_` to allow ease-of-use of functions. For example users can query the Data Discover APIs using `wt_dd_summary()` corresponding to the `get-dd-map-and-projects` and `get-dd-long-lat-summary` endpoints, and retrieve large-scale datasets, or refine it based on an area of interest.

With the acoustic and camera sensor in WildTrax release in 2018 and 2020, respectively, @fig-data-accum shows the cumulative growth of remote camera images and acoustic recordings within the ABMI and WildTrax framework. Since the launch of WildTrax 1.0 in 2018, contributions from ABMI internal programs and partner organizations have resulted in over 150 million images and 2.5 million acoustic recordings by 2025. Data accumulation has accelerated exponentially annually, reflecting increasing uptake of the platform. Projects span local to provincial scales, with a growing proportion published publicly, demonstrating the scalability and broad applicability of the system. The majority of public datasets, mainly those in the point count sensor through BAM collaborations, now represent ~10% of the proportion of Project holdings, covering [] km² of monitoring area, encompassing 263 Projects (205 ARU and point count, 58 camera) across 31 different Organizations.

# Discussion and future prospects

The expansion of environmental sensor networks for avian monitoring has fundamentally altered how ecological data can be collected, managed, and interpreted. These trends in software uptake emphasize the importance of continually upgrading and handling data management strategies, optimized storage solutions, and creating efficient analytical tools to ensure continued accessibility and usability of increasing big data. High-resolution, continuous recordings from ARUs and remote cameras generate unprecedented volumes of temporal and spatial data, yet the potential of these datasets is only realized through structured, scalable, and accessible management frameworks. Platforms such as WildTrax exemplify this need, offering centralized solutions that enable integration across sensor types, standardization of metadata, and harmonization of multi-source observations. Ongoing considerations in deploying these systems is the balance between data volume and interpretability. 

While sensors and artificial intelligence results can produce vast archives of audio and visual media, ensuring data quality and reducing noise or misclassification remains under ongoing management. Analytical pipelines that incorporate deep learning, combined with human verification, provide a mechanism to efficiently extract meaningful ecological signals while maintaining transparency and user control, shepherding futher human-computer collaboration. The potential of these platforms extends beyond single or multi-taxa monitoring; by linking fine-scale temporal datasets with spatially distributed sensors, researchers can begin to explore community-level patterns, seasonal dynamics, and multi-species interactions at scales that were previously unattainable. Furthermore, standardized, open-access repositories facilitate reproducibility and comparative studies, allowing new ecological questions to be addressed without the need to recollect data. This is particularly relevant for studies of ecosystem health and biodiversity trends, where longitudinal and multi-site datasets provide the statistical power required to detect subtle changes. 

The adoption of integrated sensor platforms also raises considerations for infrastructure, cost, and workflow design. Effective long-term monitoring relies not only on hardware reliability and data storage solutions, but also on user-friendly interfaces that allow project administrators and contributors to manage complex datasets efficiently. By supporting automated workflows alongside human oversight, platforms can reduce observer bias, improve detection accuracy, and provide verifiable, permanent records for ecological studies. Overall, while technological and computational advances have enabled large-scale environmental monitoring, the realization of these benefits is contingent upon robust data management systems. The development and refinement of platforms like WildTrax illustrate how socio-technical frameworks can mediate between raw sensor outputs and actionable ecological insights, creating opportunities for broader collaboration, reproducibility, and adaptive conservation practices across multiple spatial and temporal scales.
